* Drawer

Drawer is a lightweight OpenGL drawing program.

It aims to be a convenient and small drawing window, suitable to be
popped up at any time on your desktop for a quick drawing which could
then be saved/copied and shared.

It is in very early stages of development and as such lacks most
intended features. These include:

- [ ] undo/redo
- [ ] multiple colours
- [ ] variable width
- [ ] export image
- [ ] tablet pressure

** Building

Requires [[https://github.com/glfw/glfw][GLFW]], X11.

The inclueded ~Makefile~ contains build instructions, you can simply
clone the repository and run ~make~. The resulting binary is in ~bin~
